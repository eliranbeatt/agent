Awesome—here’s a complete, pragmatic build plan for your local, hybrid multi-agent system with an orchestrator that can both run predefined workflows and dynamically spawn sub-agents on demand.

# Product description (1-pager)

**Name:** Local Agent Studio (LAS)
**Goal:** A local, small-and-easy agent platform (OpenAI API key only) with **full control** over agent architecture, system prompts, workflows, iterations, and memory.
**Core idea:**

* A **Main Orchestrator** chooses between (a) *predefined workflows* and (b) *freeform, planner-driven execution* where an **Agent-Generator** spawns just-in-time sub-agents with tailored prompts/tools.
* A **Context Manager** normalizes files (Office/PDF/images), builds context, and feeds it to tasks.
* A lightweight **chat UI** for prompts, file uploads, and streaming responses.

**Constraints you set:**

* Runs **locally** (no cloud infra), minimal footprint.
* File support now: **Office (Word/Excel/PowerPoint), PDFs, images**.
* Start basic, but with a **global memory** that remembers profile, facts, new info, conversations, and summaries.
* “Hybrid” execution: some **predefined workflows**, plus dynamic agents with freedom to act.

# Recommended open-source stack (keeps you in control)

* **Orchestration / stateful agents:** **LangGraph** (open-source, Python/JS SDK; precise control over graph/state & agent loops). ([LangChain][1])

  * Alternatives you can swap in later: **Microsoft AutoGen** (multi-agent collaboration) and **CrewAI** (lean, simple crews). ([GitHub][2])
* **Docs & file ingestion:** **Unstructured** (robust OSS loaders for Office/PDF/images), plus LangChain loaders where convenient. ([GitHub][3])
* **Vector DB (local):** **ChromaDB** or **LanceDB** (both embedded/local friendly). Start with ChromaDB; LanceDB is great as you scale. ([Chroma][4])
* **Memory layer:** **Mem0** (OSS memory for agents; supports OpenAI). ([GitHub][5])
* **Backend:** Python **FastAPI** (simple local API).
* **UI:** **Next.js/React** minimal chat + file upload.
* **Embeddings & LLM:** OpenAI (you supply API key, local run).
* **OCR (for image PDFs):** Built into Unstructured via Tesseract/PyMuPDF routes; can add PaddleOCR later. ([Unstructured][6])

> Why this stack? It’s all open source, runs locally, and gives you **fine-grained control** over graphs, state, prompts, tools, and memory. LangGraph in particular is strong for deterministic agent loops and guardrails, while Mem0 centralizes your long-lived memories.

# Core agents (minimal, composable)

1. **Main Orchestrator (graph root)**

   * Chooses **predefined workflow** vs **planner route**; supervises loops, max-steps, and tool budgets.
2. **Planner**

   * Breaks user request into ordered tasks with inputs/outputs; sets *success criteria*.
3. **Task Identifier**

   * Maps tasks to tools/context; flags which require sub-agents.
4. **Agent-Generator**

   * Given a task + context + previous outputs, **instantiates a new sub-agent** with a tailored system prompt, tools, and stop rules.
5. **Context Manager / Tools Router**

   * Ingestion (Office/PDF/images), chunking, embeddings, retrieval, tool selection.
6. **Memory Manager**

   * Global profile, facts, conversational memory, summaries (Mem0 + vector store).
7. **Evaluator / Verifier**

   * Lightweight self-check: task success, sources used, contradictions; can trigger replans.
8. **Result Assembler**

   * Collates outputs, citations, and summaries for UI.

> Optional later: Web search agent, code-exec agent, UI-test agent. Keep v1 lean.

---

# Predefined workflows (starter set)

* **RAG QA over uploads:** Ingest → Chunk → Embed → Retrieve → Answer → Verify.
* **Summarize & Extract:** For Office/PDF/images (OCR), output bullet facts + JSON.
* **Compare & Synthesize:** Given multiple files, produce comparison tables + key insights.
* **Image-only → OCR → QA:** Extract text → answer questions with citations.

The Orchestrator can always override and route through Planner + Agent-Generator for novel tasks.

---

# Memory design (what to remember)

* **Global profile:** name, preferences, tone.
* **Stable facts:** recurring details learned across sessions.
* **New information:** incremental facts tagged with timestamp + source.
* **Conversation history:** rolling window + **summaries** per topic.
* **RAG traces:** what was retrieved & why (for future speed/quality).

Use **Mem0** for long-term memory entries + **Chroma/LanceDB** for semantic recall. ([GitHub][5])

---

# Data & config (you have “full control”)

**Everything is configuration-first** so you can edit YAML/JSON without code changes.

**`/config/agents.yaml` (example)**

```yaml
orchestrator:
  max_iters: 6
  prefer_workflow: true   # try predefined flows first
  fallback_to_planner: true

planner:
  model: "gpt-4.1"        # example; you’ll set actual model
  output_contract: [tasks, dependencies, success_criteria]

agent_generator:
  template:
    system: |
      You are a specialized agent for task: {task_name}
      Goal: {goal}
      Tools: {tools}
      Hard limits: {limits}
      Required outputs: {outputs}
    limits:
      max_steps: 4
      use_tools: true

memory:
  mem0:
    collections: [profile, facts, convo, summaries]
  vector:
    db: "chroma"          # or "lancedb"
    collection: "docs"
    chunk_size: 1000
    chunk_overlap: 150

workflows:
  rag_qa:
    steps: [ingest, embed, retrieve, answer, verify]
  summarize:
    steps: [ingest, ocr_if_needed, summarize, verify]
```

# File ingestion & RAG pipeline

1. **Loaders**

   * Office/PDF/images via **Unstructured**; fall back to LangChain loaders where convenient. ([GitHub][3])
2. **Normalization**

   * Split into semantic chunks (size 800–1,200 tokens; overlap 80–150).
3. **Embeddings**

   * OpenAI embeddings (local run, your API key).
4. **Store**

   * **ChromaDB** (embedded, simple) or **LanceDB** (scales nicely). ([Chroma][4])
5. **Retrieval**

   * k=8–12; MMR on; rerank optional.
6. **Answering**

   * Cite chunk IDs; Verifier checks claims.

---

# UI (basic but solid)

* **Next.js** chat view: left panel (history), main chat, right panel (retrieved sources).
* **File uploads:** drag-and-drop; progress; per-file ingestion status.
* **Run mode toggle:** “Predefined Workflow” vs “Autonomous (Planner)”.
* **Inspector:** show plan graph, spawned agents, tokens/steps, memory hits.

---

# Implementation plan (phased, minimal to robust)

## Phase 0 — Bootstrap (½–1 day)

* Skeleton repos: `/ui` (Next.js), `/server` (FastAPI + LangGraph), `/config`, `/data`.
* Add `.env` for OpenAI key; local run via `uvicorn` + `next dev`.

## Phase 1 — Core graph & control (2–3 days)

* Define **LangGraph** nodes: Orchestrator, Planner, Task Identifier, Agent-Generator, Context Manager, Memory Manager, Evaluator, Result Assembler.
* Implement **config-driven** agent templates & limits.
* Unit tests: plan generation; agent spawning; step limits. ([LangChain][1])

## Phase 2 — Ingestion & RAG (2–3 days)

* Wire **Unstructured** + LangChain loaders; handle Office/PDF/images + OCR.
* Add **ChromaDB** (or LanceDB) & embedding pipeline; ingestion CLI: `ingest <path>`. ([GitHub][3])
* Retrieval endpoint; basic QA workflow; citations.

## Phase 3 — Memory (1–2 days)

* Integrate **Mem0** for global profile/facts/convo/summaries; add memory policies (TTL, size caps). ([GitHub][5])
* “/memory” inspector in UI; allow user edits (delete/merge).

## Phase 4 — Evaluator & Guardrails (1–2 days)

* Implement verifier pass (check success criteria; ask for missing facts; optional replan).
* Add max-iter/timebox/compute-budget controls per agent.

## Phase 5 — UI polish (1–2 days)

* Streaming tokens, file status, sources panel, graph visual (DAG of steps).
* Toggle: Predefined vs Autonomous; show spawned agents with summaries.

**Total v1:** ~8–12 working days (solo pace). You can compress if reusing templates.

---

# Testing & acceptance

* **Unit:** Planner output schema; Agent-Generator creates correct prompts; tools called with right args.
* **Integration:** End-to-end RAG QA on sample PDFs; ingestion + retrieval + verified answer.
* **UX smoke:** Upload Office/PDF/images; ask questions; switch run modes.
* **Acceptance (v1):**

  1. Run locally with your OpenAI key.
  2. Answer questions over uploaded docs with citations.
  3. Spawn at least one dynamic sub-agent during autonomous runs.
  4. Persist & surface global memory.

# Prompts (starter templates)

**Orchestrator (system)**

```
You are the Orchestrator. Choose between a predefined workflow or a planner-driven route.
Respect limits: {max_iters}, {max_tokens}, {tool_budget}.
If predefined flow matches intent with ≥0.7 confidence, use it; else call the Planner.
Stop when success_criteria are met or limits are hit.
Always record: chosen_path, steps, tools_used, memory_hits.
```

**Planner (system)**

```
Decompose the user goal into minimal tasks with dependencies.
For each task include: name, inputs, expected_output, success_criteria.
Prefer using available context and tools; otherwise ask Context Manager to fetch/prepare it.
Output strictly as JSON {tasks:[], dependencies:[], success_criteria:[]}.
```

**Agent-Generator (system)**

```
Create a specialized agent for {task_name}.
Draft a concise system prompt with: role, goal, allowed tools, hard limits, required outputs, stop conditions.
Return a runnable spec: {prompt, tools[], limits, output_contract}.
```

**Evaluator (system)**

```
Check that outputs meet success_criteria, are grounded in retrieved sources, and contain no contradictions.
If failed, propose a minimal replan step or request missing context.
```

# Risks & mitigations

* **Tool sprawl / complexity:** Keep v1 to the listed agents; add others via config only after tests pass.
* **Parser fragility (Office/PDF):** Use Unstructured fallbacks and OCR; log parse errors with file pointers. ([Unstructured][6])
* **Hallucinations:** Always pass retrieved chunks; enforce verifier step + citations.
* **State explosions / loops:** Hard caps on steps/tokens; LangGraph loop guards. ([LangChain][1])

---

# Roadmap (after v1)

* Add **AutoGen** or **CrewAI** variants for research/benchmarking different runtimes. ([Microsoft GitHub][7])
* Tooling: web search, code executor (sandboxed), table extraction, reranking.
* Multi-tenant memory profiles; role-based presets.
* Export/import of workflows; UI to edit YAML live.
* Optional: **Microsoft Agent Framework** (new OSS combining SK + AutoGen). ([Microsoft for Developers][8])

---

# Why these choices (quick references)

* **LangGraph** = stateful, graph-based control for agents/workflows. ([LangChain][1])
* **AutoGen / CrewAI** = proven multi-agent frameworks if you want alternates. ([GitHub][2])
* **Unstructured** = best-in-class OSS ingestion for Office/PDF/images + OCR. ([GitHub][3])
* **Chroma / LanceDB** = embedded vector stores that run locally. ([Chroma][4])
* **Mem0** = open-source long-term memory for agents. ([GitHub][5])

## Final notes tailored to your bullets

1. **Hybrid**: you get both **predefined workflows** and **autonomous orchestration**.
2. **Office/PDF/images**: covered by Unstructured + OCR; RAG enabled.
3. **Local, small & easy**: FastAPI + embedded DBs; no external services needed beyond OpenAI API.
4. **“All 4”**: covered via the 4 pillars—planner, generator, context, memory (plus orchestrator & verifier).
5. **Start basic**: the phased plan gets you a working v1 fast.
6. **Global profile + memories**: Mem0 + vector store; editor UI to view/trim.

If you want, I can turn this into a repo scaffold (folders, configs, example nodes, and a minimal UI page) and a “getting started” README next.
