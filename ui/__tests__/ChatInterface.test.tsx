 * UI Integration Tests for Local Agent Studio
 * 
 * Note: These are placeholder tests demonstrating the test structure.
 * In a production environment, you would:
 * 1. Install testing dependencies: @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, jest
 * 2. Configure Jest and React Testing Library
 * 3. Implement full integration tests with mocked API calls
