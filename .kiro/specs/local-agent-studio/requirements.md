# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Local Agent Studio (LAS) is a local, hybrid multi-agent system that provides full control over agent architecture, system prompts, workflows, iterations, and memory. The system features a Main Orchestrator that can execute both predefined workflows and dynamically spawn specialized sub-agents on demand. It includes comprehensive file processing capabilities for Office documents, PDFs, and images, with a lightweight chat UI for user interaction. The platform runs entirely locally with only an OpenAI API key requirement, ensuring privacy and control while maintaining powerful agent capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Orchestration System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a main orchestrator that can intelligently choose between predefined workflows and dynamic agent generation, so that I can handle both routine tasks efficiently and novel requests flexibly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user request matches a predefined workflow with â‰¥0.7 confidence THEN the system SHALL execute the predefined workflow
2. WHEN a user request does not match predefined workflows THEN the system SHALL route to the planner-driven execution path
3. WHEN executing any workflow THEN the system SHALL respect configured limits for max iterations, tokens, and tool budget
4. WHEN workflow execution completes THEN the system SHALL record chosen path, steps taken, tools used, and memory hits
5. IF execution limits are reached THEN the system SHALL stop gracefully and report status

### Requirement 2: Dynamic Agent Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to create specialized sub-agents tailored to specific tasks, so that complex requests can be broken down and handled by purpose-built agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the planner identifies a task requiring specialized handling THEN the Agent-Generator SHALL create a sub-agent with tailored system prompt and tools
2. WHEN creating a sub-agent THEN the system SHALL include role definition, goal, allowed tools, hard limits, and required outputs
3. WHEN a sub-agent is spawned THEN it SHALL operate within defined step limits and tool constraints
4. WHEN sub-agent completes its task THEN the system SHALL collect outputs and integrate them into the overall workflow
5. IF a sub-agent fails or exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL handle the failure gracefully and report to the orchestrator

### Requirement 3: Comprehensive File Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload and process various file types including Office documents, PDFs, and images, so that I can ask questions and extract information from my documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads Office documents (Word/Excel/PowerPoint) THEN the system SHALL extract and normalize the content
2. WHEN a user uploads PDF files THEN the system SHALL extract text and handle image-based PDFs with OCR
3. WHEN a user uploads images THEN the system SHALL perform OCR to extract text content
4. WHEN files are processed THEN the system SHALL chunk content into semantic segments of 800-1200 tokens with 80-150 token overlap
5. WHEN content is chunked THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings and store in vector database
6. IF file processing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors with file pointers and attempt fallback methods

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Planning and Task Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to break down complex requests into manageable tasks with clear dependencies, so that multi-step operations can be executed systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving a complex user request THEN the Planner SHALL decompose it into minimal tasks with dependencies
2. WHEN creating tasks THEN each task SHALL include name, inputs, expected output, and success criteria
3. WHEN tasks have dependencies THEN the system SHALL execute them in correct order
4. WHEN task execution begins THEN the Task Identifier SHALL map tasks to appropriate tools and context
5. IF task dependencies cannot be resolved THEN the system SHALL request additional context or clarification

### Requirement 5: Persistent Memory Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to remember my profile, preferences, facts, and conversation history across sessions, so that interactions become more personalized and efficient over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interacts with the system THEN it SHALL maintain a global profile with name, preferences, and tone
2. WHEN new information is learned THEN the system SHALL store stable facts with timestamp and source
3. WHEN conversations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain rolling history with topic-based summaries
4. WHEN RAG operations are performed THEN the system SHALL trace what was retrieved and why for future optimization
5. WHEN memory reaches capacity limits THEN the system SHALL apply configured TTL and size cap policies

### Requirement 6: RAG and Knowledge Retrieval

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask questions about my uploaded documents and receive accurate answers with proper citations, so that I can quickly find and verify information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks questions about documents THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant chunks using semantic search
2. WHEN generating answers THEN the system SHALL include citations with chunk IDs and source references
3. WHEN retrieving information THEN the system SHALL use k=8-12 results with MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance)
4. WHEN providing answers THEN the Evaluator SHALL verify claims against retrieved sources
5. IF retrieved information is insufficient THEN the system SHALL request additional context or clarification

### Requirement 7: Local Execution and Privacy

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want the entire system to run locally with no cloud dependencies except OpenAI API, so that my data remains under my control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL run entirely on local infrastructure
2. WHEN processing files THEN all data SHALL remain on the local machine
3. WHEN using AI capabilities THEN only OpenAI API calls SHALL be made externally
4. WHEN storing data THEN embedded databases (ChromaDB/LanceDB) SHALL be used locally
5. IF network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL continue operating with cached/local data

### Requirement 8: Configuration-Driven Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure agents, workflows, and system behavior through YAML/JSON files, so that I can customize the system without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring agents THEN all parameters SHALL be defined in agents.yaml
2. WHEN defining workflows THEN predefined flows SHALL be specified in workflows.yaml
3. WHEN system starts THEN it SHALL load all configuration from files
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL reload without restart where possible
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback to defaults

### Requirement 9: User Interface and Interaction

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean chat interface with file upload capabilities and real-time feedback, so that I can easily interact with the agent system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the interface THEN it SHALL provide a chat view with history panel and main conversation area
2. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL support drag-and-drop with progress indicators
3. WHEN agents are working THEN the system SHALL stream responses in real-time
4. WHEN viewing results THEN retrieved sources SHALL be displayed in a dedicated panel
5. WHEN inspecting execution THEN users SHALL see plan graphs, spawned agents, and resource usage

### Requirement 10: Quality Assurance and Verification

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to verify its outputs and check for errors, so that I can trust the accuracy and reliability of results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks complete THEN the Evaluator SHALL check outputs against success criteria
2. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL verify claims are grounded in retrieved sources
3. WHEN detecting contradictions THEN the system SHALL flag issues and propose corrections
4. WHEN verification fails THEN the system SHALL trigger minimal replan steps or request missing context
5. IF quality thresholds are not met THEN the system SHALL prevent output delivery and request improvements
