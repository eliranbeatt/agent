# Remediation Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for fixing and completing the Local Agent Studio system based on the comprehensive gap analysis. The system is 70-80% complete but has critical issues preventing full functionality. This remediation focuses on fixing broken components, completing integrations, and ensuring all requirements are met.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Configuration System Repair

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the configuration system to load without errors and properly initialize all components, so that the system can start and operate correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system loads configuration files THEN all YAML files SHALL parse without errors
2. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN all dataclass fields SHALL match YAML field names
3. WHEN configuration validation runs THEN it SHALL report specific errors for invalid values
4. WHEN configuration has errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with file and line numbers
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fall back to documented defaults

### Requirement 2: Workflow Matching and Execution

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to recognize my requests and execute appropriate predefined workflows, so that common tasks are handled efficiently without spawning unnecessary agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user request matches workflow triggers with ≥0.7 confidence THEN the system SHALL select that workflow
2. WHEN workflow is selected THEN the system SHALL execute all workflow steps in order
3. WHEN workflow steps execute THEN the system SHALL validate success criteria for each step
4. WHEN workflow completes THEN the system SHALL record execution path as PREDEFINED_WORKFLOW
5. IF no workflow matches THEN the system SHALL route to planner-driven execution

### Requirement 3: Component Interface Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all components to have consistent initialization interfaces, so that they can be instantiated correctly throughout the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN FileProcessor is instantiated THEN it SHALL accept configuration as parameter
2. WHEN VectorStore is instantiated THEN it SHALL accept persist_directory as string parameter
3. WHEN Evaluator is used THEN it SHALL provide a callable verify() method
4. WHEN MemoryManager is used THEN it SHALL provide store_conversation() method
5. WHEN Chunker is imported THEN SemanticChunker SHALL be available

### Requirement 4: RAG Pipeline Completion

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload documents and ask questions with cited answers, so that I can quickly find and verify information in my documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN it SHALL be processed, chunked, and embedded automatically
2. WHEN a question is asked THEN relevant chunks SHALL be retrieved with similarity scores
3. WHEN an answer is generated THEN it SHALL include citations with chunk IDs and sources
4. WHEN answer is verified THEN it SHALL be checked for grounding in retrieved sources
5. IF answer quality is insufficient THEN the system SHALL request additional context or replan

### Requirement 5: Memory Persistence Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to remember information across sessions, so that I don't have to repeat context and the system becomes more personalized over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Mem0 is configured THEN it SHALL initialize with OpenAI integration
2. WHEN conversations occur THEN they SHALL be stored with timestamps and summaries
3. WHEN facts are learned THEN they SHALL be stored with source attribution
4. WHEN system restarts THEN previous memories SHALL be available
5. WHEN memory capacity is reached THEN retention policies SHALL be applied automatically

### Requirement 6: Real-Time UI Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see live updates of execution progress, resource usage, and agent activity, so that I understand what the system is doing and can monitor long-running operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN execution starts THEN UI SHALL show status change to "running"
2. WHEN agents are spawned THEN UI SHALL display agent information in inspector panel
3. WHEN resources are consumed THEN UI SHALL update token and step counters in real-time
4. WHEN plan graph changes THEN UI SHALL update task status and dependencies
5. WHEN execution completes THEN UI SHALL show final status and results

### Requirement 7: Test Coverage and Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests that validate all functionality, so that I can confidently make changes and deploy the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN acceptance tests run THEN all 24 tests SHALL pass
2. WHEN unit tests run THEN code coverage SHALL be ≥90% for core components
3. WHEN integration tests run THEN all workflows SHALL execute successfully
4. WHEN UI tests run THEN all components SHALL render and function correctly
5. IF tests fail THEN error messages SHALL clearly indicate the problem and location

### Requirement 8: Optional Dependencies Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to process image-based documents with OCR, so that I can extract and query text from scanned documents and images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Tesseract is installed THEN OCR SHALL be available for image processing
2. WHEN image files are uploaded THEN text SHALL be extracted with confidence scores
3. WHEN OCR fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with available content
4. WHEN OCR is unavailable THEN the system SHALL warn user and disable image workflows
5. IF OCR quality is low THEN confidence scores SHALL be reported to user

### Requirement 9: Documentation Completeness

**User Story:** As a new user or developer, I want complete and accurate documentation, so that I can install, configure, and use the system without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading installation guide THEN all steps SHALL be current and accurate
2. WHEN following troubleshooting guide THEN common issues SHALL have clear solutions
3. WHEN reading API documentation THEN all endpoints SHALL be documented with examples
4. WHEN reading user guide THEN all features SHALL be explained with screenshots
5. IF documentation is outdated THEN it SHALL be flagged for update

### Requirement 10: Production Readiness

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to be production-ready with proper security, monitoring, and deployment options, so that I can deploy it confidently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying with Docker THEN all services SHALL start and communicate correctly
2. WHEN production config is used THEN appropriate security settings SHALL be applied
3. WHEN monitoring is enabled THEN metrics SHALL be collected and dashboards available
4. WHEN errors occur THEN alerts SHALL be sent to configured channels
5. IF security audit is performed THEN no critical vulnerabilities SHALL be found
